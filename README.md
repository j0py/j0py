In school, there were 3 guys named 'johan', so i came up with 'j0py'.

I like to make music (drums, cajon, guitar, sing), i like to dance to it, and i work 20+ years in IT.

In 2020 i discovered SuperCollider, and i think live coding is the coolest thing.  
Since then i learn / make tools for live coding.  

2020
- checked out many SuperCollider tutorials (Eli Fieldsteel, Reflections, ..)
- checked out Chuck, FoxDot, Tidal, Orca, ..

2021
- create nodeproxy wrapper class making Tidal syntax possible in SClang
- create visuals to show during live coding
- create sounds

2022
- the Tidal thing is now called "Pmini", an eventpattern generator with Tidal "mini notation" syntax

2023
- the Tidal thing renamed itself to "Tidy" with "Pmini" as a spin-off. Evolving and getting better and better. The numbers for euclidean rhythms have become patternable too!
- working on the other half of the fun: making original sounds (mangled samples, synthdefs)
