In school, there were 3 guys named 'johan', so i came up with 'j0py'.

I play drums in indie-rock band 'Wolfcoat' (Amsterdam based), i work 20+ years in IT.

In 2020 i discovered SuperCollider, i think live coding is the coolest thing.  
Since then i learn / make tools for live coding.  
Dream scenario: take my laptop + portable speaker and live code in the wild.

2020
- checked out many SuperCollider tutorials (Eli Fieldsteel, Reflections, ..)
- checked out Chuck, FoxDot, Tidal, ..

2021
- start using Emacs for coding with SuperCollider, although i wonder why
- create nodeproxy wrapper class makeing Tidal syntax possible in SClang
- create p5.js visuals driven by SuperCollider behind semi-transparent editor in which i am live coding
- :-)
