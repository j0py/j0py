In school, there were 3 guys named 'johan', so i came up with 'j0py'.

I play drums in indie-rock band 'Wolfcoat' (Amsterdam based), i work 20+ years in IT.

In 2020 i discovered SuperCollider, and i think live coding is the coolest thing.  
Since then i learn / make tools for live coding.  
Dream scenario: take my laptop + portable speaker and live code in the wild.

2020
- checked out many SuperCollider tutorials (Eli Fieldsteel, Reflections, ..)
- checked out Chuck, FoxDot, Tidal, ..

2021
- create nodeproxy wrapper class making Tidal syntax possible in SClang
- create visuals to show during live coding
- create sounds

2022
- the Tidal thing is now called "Pmini", an eventpattern generator with a compact syntax lightly derived from Tidal "mini notation"
